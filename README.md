#  OVERVIEW 

Kinesis is an infinitely scalable stream as a service that consists of shards. The service is commonly used due to its ease of use and low overhead alongside its competitive pricing. This is a common differentiator between Kinesis Streams and Kafka.
Like any managed service, Amazon Kinesis has some limitations you should be familiar with â€” and how to overcome these with scaling and throttling. It will be wise to leverage the AWS provided producers, consumers and available tools in order to leverage these best practices.
